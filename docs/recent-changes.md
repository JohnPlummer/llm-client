## Known Limitations

### Current Constraints
- **Batch Size**: Fixed at 10 text items per API call
- **Sequential Processing**: Batches processed one at a time
- **Rate Limiting**: `MaxConcurrent` not yet implemented
- **Model Selection**: Hard-coded to GPT-4o-mini

### Future Enhancements
- **Concurrent Batch Processing**: Planned `MaxConcurrent` support
- **Configurable Batch Size**: User-defined batch sizing
- **Model Selection**: Support for different OpenAI models
- **Caching Layer**: Response caching for repeated content

## Migration Notes

### From Previous Versions
- No breaking changes in recent updates
- Enhanced error handling is backward compatible
- New Make commands are additive

### Configuration Changes
- No configuration changes required
- Environment variable handling remains unchanged
- API key requirements unchanged

## Performance Characteristics

### Current Performance
- **Batch Size**: 10 text items per API call (optimal for most use cases)
- **Model**: GPT-4o-mini (cost-optimized choice)
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation with minimal performance impact
- **Memory Usage**: Efficient with batch processing approach

### Monitoring Recommendations
- Monitor OpenAI API response times
- Track scoring success rates
- Watch for missing score warnings in logs
- Monitor batch processing efficiency
