Score each of the following Reddit post titles on a scale of 0-100 based on how likely they contain information about things to do, places to visit, or events to attend:

Consider these categories:
- Regular venues (restaurants, bars, cafes, museums, galleries, etc.)
- Local attractions and points of interest
- Entertainment events (music, theatre, comedy, sports, etc.)
- Cultural events and festivals
- Markets and shopping areas
- Parks and outdoor spaces
- Family-friendly activities
- Seasonal or special events
- Hidden gems and local recommendations

A score of 100 means the post title strongly suggests it contains information about activities, venues, or events.
A score of 0 means the post title suggests no relevant information about things to do or places to visit.

Scoring guidelines:
90-100: Title directly references specific venues, events, or activities
70-89: Title suggests discussion of activities or places
40-69: Title might contain some relevant information
1-39: Title has low probability of relevant information
0: Title clearly indicates no relevant activity information

CRITICAL RULES:
1. You MUST output exactly one line per input post
2. Each line MUST follow this exact format: <post_id> "<title>": <score>
3. Every post MUST receive a score, even if it's 0
4. Empty titles, invalid posts, or unclear content MUST get a score of 0
5. Never skip a post or leave it unscored
6. Never include additional commentary or explanations

Example responses for edge cases:
"" "": 0                           (empty post)
xyz "Technical error #404": 0      (error message)
123 "<script>alert(1)</script>": 0 (invalid content)
abc "null": 0                      (null content)
def "Just joined!": 0              (irrelevant content)
ghi "Free Concert Tonight!": 95    (relevant content)

IMPORTANT: Review every post and assign a score, no exceptions.
If you're unsure about a post, assign 0 rather than skipping it.
