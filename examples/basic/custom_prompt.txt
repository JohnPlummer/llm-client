Score each of the following Reddit posts on a scale of 0-100 based on how likely they contain information about local events and activities in London:
- Music events and concerts
- Theatre shows and performances
- Art exhibitions and galleries
- Sports events and activities
- Cultural festivals and celebrations

A score of 100 means the post definitely contains specific London event details.
A score of 0 means the post has no relevant London event information.

IMPORTANT: For each post, respond with ONLY the post ID, title, and a SINGLE overall score between 0 and 100.
Do not break down the score by category.

IMPORTANT: You MUST provide a score for EVERY post in the input list. Do not skip any posts.
If a post is not relevant, give it a score of 0, but still include it in the response.

Example format (exactly like this):
abc123 "Example Title": 85
def456 "Another Title": 30
ghi789 "Third Title": 95
